<h2>Visualization 1: Building Count by County</h2>

<iframe src="bar_chart.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>
This bar chart presents the number of state-owned buildings across Illinois, aggregated by county. Each bar corresponds to a county and represents the total number of buildings listed under that county in the dataset. The purpose of this visualization is to provide a high-level understanding of which regions in Illinois maintain a higher concentration of public infrastructure. This can be useful in policy planning, regional development assessments, and infrastructure resource allocation.
</p>

<h3>Design choices and encodings:</h3>
<p>
The x-axis encodes the <strong>County</strong> variable as a nominal type, while the y-axis encodes the count of buildings as a quantitative field using <code>count():Q</code>. The bars are rendered using Altair’s <code>mark_bar()</code> function. Each county is also assigned a unique color using a categorical color scheme applied via the <code>County:N</code> field. This improves visual distinction and allows for easier comparison between counties.
</p>

<h3>Data transformations:</h3>
<p>
Prior to plotting, the data was cleaned by removing rows with missing or blank County values. This was done using a simple filter condition to ensure that undefined entries did not appear in the visualization or interfere with grouping and aggregation logic.
</p>

<h3>Rendering on Jekyll page:</h3>
<p>
This plot has been embedded into the Jekyll page as an interactive HTML chart using an iframe. It displays correctly without errors and meets the rubric requirement for inclusion and clarity.
</p>

<h2>Visualization 2: Building Size by Year Constructed (Interactive)</h2>

<iframe src="scatter_plot.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>
This scatter plot analyzes the relationship between the year a building was constructed and its size, measured in square footage. Each data point represents an individual building. This plot is designed to highlight construction trends over time and identify how building sizes may have changed across different periods. It also allows for regional comparison by coloring data points based on the county to which the building belongs.
</p>

<h3>Design choices and encodings:</h3>
<p>
The x-axis represents <strong>Year Constructed</strong> (quantitative), and the y-axis represents <strong>Square Footage</strong> (quantitative). Each point is colored by the <strong>County</strong> field, which is encoded as a nominal variable. Tooltips are provided for additional context, including location name, city, year constructed, and building size. The points are rendered using <code>mark_circle()</code> with a fixed size for visual uniformity. Color was used to differentiate counties and improve interpretability when filtering data.
</p>

<h3>Data transformations:</h3>
<p>
The dataset required multiple preprocessing steps before visualization. Records with missing values in <strong>Year Constructed</strong> or <strong>Square Footage</strong> were removed using <code>dropna()</code>. Both fields were also explicitly converted to numeric types using <code>pd.to_numeric()</code> to ensure compatibility with Altair encodings and prevent errors during plotting.
</p>

<h3>Interactivity:</h3>
<p>
This visualization includes advanced interactivity in two forms:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A dropdown menu that allows users to select a specific county or view all counties simultaneously. The chart dynamically filters based on the selected county, updating the view in real time.</li>
  <li>Pan and zoom capabilities are enabled using <code>.interactive()</code>, allowing users to explore dense regions of the plot or zoom in on specific time periods or building sizes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The dropdown is implemented using <code>alt.binding_select()</code> and <code>selection_single</code>, and the conditional filter is handled within <code>transform_filter()</code> to manage the "All" option effectively.
</p>

<h3>Rendering on Jekyll page:</h3>
<p>
The interactive version of this chart is embedded in the Jekyll site using an iframe. It renders directly on the page, providing live filtering and navigation. This satisfies all rubric criteria for advanced interactivity.
